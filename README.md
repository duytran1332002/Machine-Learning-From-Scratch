## About the Project 
In this project, I try to recode some popular Machine Learning algorithms such as K - Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, ... from scratch and testing in table data like Titanic data, Spambase data with main purpose having some experience about how to train a good Machine Learning model and understand clear about how model work. 

## Model
 

## Model and Result
In model.py contain some ML model - KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, Genetic Algorithm, Linear Regression with Pytorch and Numpy.
I compared some classified model with two data set - Titanic and Spambase (data folder).

### K-Nearest Neighbor

| Data | Test Accuracy | Precision - 0 | Recall - 0 | F1-Score - 0| Precision - 1 | Recall - 1 | F1-Score - 1| 
| ---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Titanic| 9.1s | 42s |
| Spambase | 0.3s | 0.3s |
